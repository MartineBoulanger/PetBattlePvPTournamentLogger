# PetBattlePvPTournamentLogger

World of Warcraft addon for the Pet Battle PvP Tournaments!

This is a simple in use addon specifically created for the Pet Battle PvP Tournaments, but it can also be used for when you would want to log your PvP pet battles.

## What does it do?

Quite simple, it will log every PvP pet battle you do, since in the tournament each match is **Best of 5** the addon will only save up to 5 battles, if you do not delete the data before your next match, the addon will delete the oldest battle first (whenever the player are playing a 6th battle or more).

The addon will also save up the pet usage from each battle, this means that it will store the pets that are used in both teams, together with the pet's type, health, power, and speed stats, and the number of battles it has played.

## Why does the battles need to be saved?

The owner of the tournament, and also the staff, wants to see proof of when a match has been done. And besides streaming the matches (which is not obliged to do so), getting the logs from the battles with all the necessary data is really good proof to show that the match has been played honestly.

## What about the pet usage data?

Besides sending the battle logs for proof, we would like to ask you to send us the pet usage data as well, this is for our statistics, which is important for future tournaments.

## Why can't I log PvE battles?

Because this addon is specifically made for the Pet Battle PvP Tournament, which is only PvP battles.

## How to use it?

When you have installed the addon, you simply log into the game, the chat will show a message that the addon has been initialize, you will also see the slash command there would you forgot about that.

The slash command to open the addon is: **/petpvplog**

When you open the addon, you will see an empty window with 3 buttons at the bottom.

- The left button is to show the battle logs, when you click on it, the logs will show up in an edit box, you can scroll through them if you want, the battles are logged from oldest to newest (top to bottom). You can then do ctrl-a to select all the text, and then ctrl-c to copy it, so that you then can paste it in a message on Discord. To leave the battle logs, you have to press the **escape** button on your keyboard.
- The middle button is to show the pet usage summary, when clicking on this button it will also open up the edit box with the list of the pets that are used in the battles. Here you also can do ctrl-a to select everything, and then ctrl-c to copy the text. You also have to press on **escape** to hide the edit box.
- The right button is to delete all data, which means to delete **all** battle logs and pet usage data. The button will show a popup to ask you if you are sure to delete all the data. **Please Note!** You have to make sure you have deleted all the data before you start your next match, make sure you start with an empty addon.

In the chat window you will see different messages, warnings, and alerts to let you know what the addon is doing.
